# Composed Components Folder 📂

The `resources/js/Components/lib/composed` folder contains high-level, pre-assembled components that combine multiple smaller, reusable components into cohesive UI sections. These "composed" components are designed to simplify development by encapsulating complex layouts or functionalities into a single, reusable unit.

---

## 📂 Purpose

The `composed` folder is intended to:

- **Simplify Complex Layouts**: Combine smaller UI elements into ready-to-use, structured components.
- **Encourage Reusability**: Provide reusable compositions for common UI patterns.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Centralize complex UI logic, reducing clutter in page-level components.
- **Accelerate Development**: Allow developers to quickly integrate well-defined sections into the app.

## 📂 Folder Structure

1. **`CTAComposed.tsx`**

   - A prebuilt call-to-action section designed to highlight key actions or promotions.

2. **`DashboardPageComposed.tsx`**

   - A complete layout for dashboard pages, integrating various sections like header, content, and sidebar.

3. **`HeroComposed.tsx`**

   - A hero section designed for landing pages, combining titles, subtitles, and call-to-action buttons.

4. **`SectionComposed.tsx`**

   - A flexible component for structuring distinct sections within a page.

5. **`SidebarComposed.tsx`**
   - A fully functional sidebar component for navigation and additional content display.

## 🛠️ How It Fits Into the Project

1. **Higher-Level Abstractions**:

   - These components abstract commonly used sections, making them easier to manage and integrate.

2. **Efficient Development**:

   - Instead of assembling smaller components repeatedly, developers can use these ready-made compositions.

3. **Consistency Across Pages**:
   - Ensures that similar sections (e.g., sidebars or CTAs) maintain a uniform design and behavior.

---

## 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Streamlined Integration**: Quickly add complex sections like CTAs, hero banners, or sidebars without extra assembly.
- **Consistency**: Provides uniform layouts and behaviors across different parts of the app.
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Encapsulates reusable compositions, avoiding repetitive code in page components.

The `composed` folder is essential for managing high-level UI elements, enabling a clean, modular, and efficient approach to building feature-rich pages in the CinemaNow application.
